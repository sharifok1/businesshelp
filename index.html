                <p>Creators can gain independence through a decentralised digital currency system that is
                    dependent on growing and engaging with the community and also their star power. They own
                    10-15% of the total value of the tokens minted.</p>

                <p>Holding social tokens allows the individual to gain access to benefits including unreleased
                    content, private communities, direct access to celebrity, early-access to tickets and more as well
                    as the ability to trade with other communities in order to gain access to more creator content with
                    early token buyers being the biggest winners as the value of the token increases with more
                    buyers. </p>

                    There are several thousand celebrities and creators on twitter, tiktok, Instagram and YouTube with followings in the millions who we would be actively engaging before we go viral. 
    
                    We would get them on our
                    platform and they would see the opportunity to create a fan driven digital economy where their digital content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans can have the monetary value of their creator's currency increase significantly as they promote their digital currency across their channels while our native token holders benefit from the Tokners popularity.

        <h1>Tokners is coming</h1>
        <p>
            Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world population with some countries
            and entities actively fighting against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds
            holding the fort. <br>
            <br>
            Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens launched all
            aiming to fix one problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is
            to bring mass adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So
            down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers and have them
            download an app, buy into the social currency of their favourite person and watch their
            investment as is with other cryptocurrency project. <br>
            <br>
            We are trying to do to this space what
            investment apps did for the "nonexistent retail investors". We are gamefying digital currency,
            bringing in popular faces instead of hard to understand projects to make it the norm  and inadvertently being the "gateway drug" for a lot of people to finally give this space a real look. <br>
            <br>
            A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as countries and creators
            would be paid beyond the peanuts that conventional social media platforms can offer. 

            There
            would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer would not find home there. Like Kanye
            said, "Personalities would become the new currency, and services would be built on top of them".
            Well, Kanye didn't exactly say that, but it sounds like something we hope he would say.

            Currency is digital, it has been that way for a while now, but this time there would be no dead
            presidents on the money, there would people like you on the money, and you would own it
            because it would make the most sense in the world.
